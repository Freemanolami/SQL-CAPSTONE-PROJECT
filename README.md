## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Sample-Superstore-Complete.csv (imported as `Store`)
- **Total Rows**: 9,994
- **Initial Observations**:
  - Contains 21 columns.
  - `Order Date` and `Ship Date` were stored as text and needed conversion.
  - `Postal_Code` had missing values.
  - Duplicate records were found based on combinations of `Order_ID`, `Customer_ID`, `Product_ID`, and `Sales`.

##  Project Structure

- **Database**: `Super_store`
- **Tables Created**:
  - `Customers`
  - `Products`
  - `Orders`
  - `Sales`

- **Normalization**:
  - Redundant and mixed columns from the original dataset were split into multiple normalized tables.
  - Surrogate keys were used where appropriate.
  - Duplicates were removed using CTEs and `ROW_NUMBER()`.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning

Key cleaning steps included:
- Handling missing postal codes.
- Converting date fields into `DATE` data type.
- Identifying and removing exact duplicate entries.
- Ensuring referential integrity between tables via proper `JOIN` conditions.
